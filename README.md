==================

Install script for TF2


How to use:
1. Run the script, it will prompt you to enter the name of the server (this is used for screen name and directory name)

2. Enter the name

3. Enter the server port

4. Enter the server rcon password

5. It will go through a lengthy process (usually 15-20 minutes depending on how steamcmd acts) to install the server

6. Navigate into the directory it created

7. As it said, there will be 3 shell scripts:
  1. ./start.sh - starts the server
  2. ./end.sh - stops the server
  3. ./update.sh - updates the server (make sure you stop it first)
